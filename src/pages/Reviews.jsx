Enjoyed the Mall Road in Murree, though the weekend crowds were a bit much. Great way to explore our own country!",

Our guide adjusted the itinerary when the weather turned bad one day, and we still managed to see all the main spots. The roads were rough in some areas but our driver handled it well.",
