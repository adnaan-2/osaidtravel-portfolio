<h3>1. MASJID AL-NABAWI</h3>
<p>Masjid al-Nabawi, or the Prophet's Mosque, is a mosque in Madina, Saudi Arabia. It is the resting place of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (SAW), second only to the Al-Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) constructed this mosque personally. It is now a major destination for Muslims worldwide visiting for Ziyarat in Madina.</p>

<h3>2. JANNAT AL-BAQI</h3>
<p>Jannat al-Baqi, also known as Baqi' al-Gharqad, is situated in Medina, Saudi Arabia. Muslims worldwide regard it as one of the most sacred places in Islam. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) established this cemetery which has been used ever since. Muslims still visit this significant destination for reflection and pilgrimage, going for Ziyarat in Madina to pay their respects.</p>

<h3>3. QUBA MOSQUE</h3>
<p>The Quba Mosque is one of the most ancient sites for Ziyarat in Madina, Saudi Arabia. Since it is the very first mosque constructed in the history of Islam, it holds great importance for Muslims. The mosque initially existed as a small structure made of mud and palm leaves but was expanded and rebuilt multiple times throughout the centuries. Today, Quba Mosque is a large, modern mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims from around the world visit every year to offer their prayers. It remains a great center for pilgrimage and a symbol of the early history of Islam.</p>

<h3>4. UHUD MOUNTAIN</h3>
<p>Uhud Mountain is located within the city of Medina, Saudi Arabia. It was the site of the Battle of Uhud, where Muslims faced a setback. Today, the mountain is a favorite pilgrimage site among Muslims, who come to visit for Ziyarat in Madina and honor the martyred soldiers of Islam. The region near the mountain contains numerous monuments and graves related to the historic battle.</p>

<h3>5. MASJID AL-QIBLATAIN</h3>
<p>Masjid al-Qiblatain holds historical significance to Muslims due to its unique feature - it is the world's only mosque with two qibla walls, one facing Jerusalem and the other facing Makkah. It is believed to have been constructed during the era of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) when the direction of prayer was changed from Jerusalem to Mecca. This mosque in Madina, Saudi Arabia, is among the most popular places visited by Muslims who come on Ziyarat to Madina.</p>

<h3>6. THE BAAB-AS-SALAAM</h3>
<p>The Baab-As-Salaam (Arabic: باب السلام), meaning "Peace Gate" in English, is one of the doors at Makkah's Al-Masjid-al-Haram. It has long been tradition for first-time visitors to enter through this gate. This gate is near Mount Marwah in the area between Mount Safa and Marwah. The "Bani Sheeba" gate is the entrance through which pilgrims come to perform the Arrival Tawaf. Sultan Soleiman Khan refurbished it in 931 Hijri and again in the 2000s.</p>

<h3>7. MOSQUE AL GHAMAMAH</h3>
<p>The Mosque Al Ghamamah is a modest-sized mosque that, while not among the principal landmarks of Medina, is nonetheless a sacred place for pilgrims. It was the first mosque where Friday prayers (Jum'ah) were performed. Tradition says that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) conducted the initial Jum'ah prayers in this mosque after Muslims migrated from Mecca to Medina. While visiting this mosque during Ziyarat to Madina, it is essential to adhere to the dress code, observe prayer times, and respect the religious and cultural customs.</p>

<h3>8. BATTLEFIELD OF THE TRENCH (KHANDAQ)</h3>
<p>The Battle of the Trench, also known as the Battle of Khandaq, occurred in 627 CE when the Quraysh and their allies besieged Madinah. The Muslims, under Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) guidance, dug a trench around parts of Medina to prevent the enemy from entering. The battle is remembered for the valuable lesson it imparts on remaining steadfast in adversity, with perseverance, faith, and determination. The site of this historic battle is visited by Muslims during their Ziyarat in Madina.</p>
